Insights from data exploration and storage/query speed explained 


From my data exploration step I was able to see the type of data that is stored in each of the field and how the data is organized. 

I need to fix the type of data that is stored in the 6th column the data type is mixed up. 

When I ran a pandas script I found the type of data in each field.

VendorID                 float64
tpep_pickup_datetime      object
tpep_dropoff_datetime     object
passenger_count          float64
trip_distance            float64
RatecodeID               float64
store_and_fwd_flag        object
PULocationID               int64
DOLocationID               int64
payment_type             float64
fare_amount              float64
extra                    float64
mta_tax                  float64
tip_amount               float64
tolls_amount             float64
improvement_surcharge    float64
total_amount             float64
congestion_surcharge     float64

To clean up the data I think it would be best discard the vendorID, and store_and_fwd_flag fields. This information will not hold much value to the analyst in solving their problems.  With that being said this will also solve the data type error
That we are getting on the 6th column which corresponds to the  store_and_fwd_flag fields.

We will need to add a new table to show Rate codes and what the different numbers mean. 

Another thing I will need to do to clean up the data is that before 2015 there was no Improvement_surcharge of .30.  To normalize the data I will Either need to get rid of the column all together or I will need to create a blank column and set the value to zero. Since there was no charge before that year.

This website is really important because it shows what is being stored in each of the different fields. 

I think it would be best to create also create a new table with where the LocationID are referring to- what part of 
New York so it makes it easier to see where the data is pointing to. 

The best way to compress the files and data would be to use lossless compression method.
